    <h1>About Pathways</h1>
    <p><b>Pathways</b> is a mobile app designed to help students reconnect with their goals, values, and sense of purpose. In a world where academic pressures often overshadow personal growth, Pathways provides a space for students to reflect, engage in self-discovery, and make meaningful progress towards their aspirations.</p>
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>Pathways empowers individuals to pause, reflect, and realign with their values through interactive and engaging exercises. The app offers tools for clarifying long-term goals, recognizing personal growth, and building a supportive community.</p>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Pathways features dynamic, user-centered tools that help:</p>
        <p><b>Clarify purpose through guided reflection exercises.</b></p>
        <p><b>Track personal progress and celebrate milestones.</b></p>
        <p><b>Set meaningful, achievable goals aligned with values.</b></p>
        <p><b>Foster a sense of community by connecting with others on similar journeys.</b></p>
    <h2>Why Pathways?</h2>
    <p>Traditional self-reflection tools can feel generic or disengaging. Pathways takes a different approach by combining research-backed methods with interactive design to make reflection both productive and enjoyable. The mobile-first platform makes it easier to prioritize well-being while navigating academic life.</p>
